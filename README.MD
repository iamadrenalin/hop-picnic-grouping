## if(localStorage.getItem("buttonClicked"))
Uses the localStorage object to store the value whether the button has already been clicked. 


## btn.disabled = true;
The code checks if the button has been clicked before and disables the button if it has been clicked. 


## else
If the button has not been clicked before, the code adds a click eventListener to the button and disables it after it has been clicked.


## localStorage.setItem("buttonClicked", true)
Stores a value in localStorage to indicate that the button has been clicked.


## Conclusion
This approach uses the localStorage object, which means that the button can only be clicked once per device and browser however, if a user clears their browser data or uses a different device or browser, they will be able to click the button again.
